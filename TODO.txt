3d sprite/voxel/splat thing in canvas2D

a d strafes left-right relative to look direction
q e up/down 

refactor drawdistance into RetroBuffer pset  --depth based color  (fog)


splat class
    vertex
    colors + DTH
    size
    shape type
        circle
        point
        square  -with orientation?
        rect
        sprite with rotation
        
splat rendering
    scaled sprite
    triangles
    filled triangles


scale and rotation of shapes

functions needed:
    generate points along a line

    generate point arrays for basic geometry
        platonic solids


    generate evenly distributed random splats on a surface

    animate transform of splat meshes

    animate size of splats

instance splat meshes




GAME:
really difficult tunnel runner.
    easy implementation
