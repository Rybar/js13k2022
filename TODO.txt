3d sprite/voxel/splat thing in canvas2D

figure out 3d maths for actual typical flight / fps controls
w/z flys 'into' screen
a d strafes left-right relative to look direction
mousemove changes look at direction

splat class
    vertex
    colors + dither
    size
    shape type
        circle
        point
        square
        sprite

splat rendering
    scaled sprite
    triangle
    filled triangle
    depth based color

splat mesh class
    set of splats 
    transform

scale and rotation of shapes

functions needed:
    generate points along a line

    generate point arrays for basic geometry
        platonic solids


    generate evenly distributed random splats on a surface

    animate transform of splat meshes

    animate size of splats

instance splat meshes




GAME:
really difficult tunnel runner.
    easy implementation
