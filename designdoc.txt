        vine attack.

    movement
     basic patrol

    machine fans
        machine fans attached to larger machines than can overheat and explode
        attack fans to disable them

Score:
    per machine fan destroyed
    per enemy destroyed
    per enemy hit
    combo, things destroyed with one attack

levels
    as a turn away from previous games, this game will feature small procedural levels
    with a clear goal rather than one big world.  

    levels are either above ground or below ground
    floating rocks/mountains pandora style - basically a sparsely populated cave
    underground mining areas - caves with many small pockets

    levels are complete when all machines are down
    bonus for killing all living critters

visual goals:
    a decent vine growth + flowers system
    vine attacks persist in the world once committed
    good amount of polish on explosions
        big circle particles for fire and smoke that floats upwards
    parallax decor - clouds, mountains, etc.
    lots of score juice
